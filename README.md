game introduction
The game requires 4 people, the first of which is the number 7 and the people there will follow the shovel 7 and play cards. If not, you will need to fold the card. The overwritten card can no longer be opened or retrieved. Other players cannot watch. The ultimate goal is to arrange the cards on the handles in order!
